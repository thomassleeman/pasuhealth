            Self-guided learning removes many barriers to mental health
            education. By allowing individuals to engage with sensitive topics
            privately and progress at a comfortable speed, our resources create
            a safe space for genuine growth. This approach often results in
            deeper internalization of concepts and greater willingness to adopt
            new practices.
